Excercise name: Mini Challenge EightToTen Endpoints

Description: Create endpoints
1. Magic 8 Ball: create an endpoint that generates 8 unique responses. One controller
2. Guess It: create 3 endpoints (one controller) that takes an input, then outputs if the number is higher or lower than the number guessed.
Easy Mode 1-10
Medium Mode 1-50
Hard Mode 1-100
3. Restaurant Picker: create 1 endpoint (one controller) that takes an input and generates a Randomly Generated Restaurant. The endpoint will be a different restaurant category that generates a random restaurant based on that category.  10 Restaurants per category.

All endpoints work on swagger and postman. For the guess it, when you try to input something that isn't a number it doesn't display a message to say that the input was invalid. For the magic 8 ball, I think the assignment wants a random response to display instead of having the user enter their own responses. Restaurant picker looks good.
